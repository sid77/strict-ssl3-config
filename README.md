strict-ssl3-config
==================

This add-on toggles security.ssl3 preferences between default and strict mode.

In default mode, all preferences are reset to their default value.
In strict mode, whitelisted preferences are flipped to "true" while everything
else goes to "false".
There is a set of ignored preferences that Mozilla set to "false" by default,
these are ignored by the add-on.

The padlock icon is a modified Tango! "emblem-readonly" icon.
